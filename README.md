To-Do List Application
This project is a simple, command-line To-Do List application developed in C. Designed for beginners and anyone looking to work on task management utilities, this program enables users to manage daily tasks directly from the terminal. It’s lightweight, uses standard C libraries, and can run on any system with a C compiler.

Features
Add Multiple Tasks: Users can add multiple tasks at once with clear prompts. Each task has a description and an incomplete status by default, allowing users to track new tasks easily.

View All Tasks: The application displays all tasks in an organized list format, showing each task's number, description, and completion status. It’s easy to review tasks and see which are done and which are pending.

Remove Tasks: With the remove function, users can specify tasks by their index to delete them from the list. The list updates immediately, helping users maintain only relevant tasks.

Save and Load: Task data is saved to a text file, ensuring that the task list persists between sessions. Each time the application is launched, it automatically loads previously saved tasks, so users can continue from where they left off.

How to Use
Compilation: Compile the code with a C compiler, e.g., gcc or clang.
Execution: Run the compiled file from your terminal.
Task Management: Use the interactive menu to add, view, remove, save, or exit.
Project Benefits
This application provides a hands-on learning experience for working with data structures (like arrays and structs), file handling, and user input in C. By building this project, developers get familiar with creating simple, menu-driven interfaces and handling file I/O operations to store data persistently.

Future Enhancements
Planned updates include marking tasks as completed, filtering completed/incomplete tasks, and improving file handling to use more robust methods like binary files for larger data sets.
